First make sure you have python installed on your machine, you can do
this simply by typing "python --version" at the command prompt.  If
you are told "command not found", then you need to download and
install python.  Vers 2.6 or 2.7 are probably best - this hasn't been
tested on vers 3.0.

Next, assuming you downloaded the lsseq-1.5.tar.gz file to your home
directory then typed:

$ tar -xvf lsseq-1.5.tar.gz

Then to install 'lsseq' log in as root and run following commands:

$ su -
# cd ~yourUserName/lsseq-1.5
# python setup.py install
# exit

To test it properly cd into a directory containing frames from an
image sequence then 'lsseq' the contents of the directory.

If you don't have one handy you can try this to test it.

$ cd ~
$ mkdir tmp
$ cd tmp
$ touch aaa.001.tif aaa.002.tif aaa.003.tif aaa.004.tif aaa.005.tif
$ lsseq
aaa.[001-005].tif z:[1-5]

Note the "z:[1-5]" which is telling you that the frames
aaa.[001-005].tif have zero length, and if you had generated those
with a renderer you'd likely need to rerender them.  Handy eh!?

Type:

$ lsseq -help

for much more useful info.
