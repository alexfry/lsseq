How to install lsseq, expandseq and condenseseq on your computer.

lsseq, expandseq and condenseseq are three command line utilities to
help you deal with sequences of images from the command line.

lsseq is designed to have the flavor and power of the unix/linux "ls"
program as much as possible.  The idea is to make it easier on the
user when switching back and forth between using "lsseq" and regular
"ls" so that the look of the output as well as several command-line-
arguments are the same (where possible and it makes sense).

There are also two utilities that expand and condense lists of frame
numbers into a fairly standard format used by many computer-graphics
programs and CG-production studios.

To install these commands locally follow these steps.

First make sure you have python installed on your machine, you can do
this simply by typing "python --version" at the command prompt.  If
you are told "command not found", then you need to download and
install python.  Vers 2.6 or 2.7 are probably best - this hasn't been
tested on vers 3.0.

1) Download the lsseq-*.tar.gz (replace * with the latest version
   number). Let's assume for discussion that the latest version is
   1.602.

2) Uncompress the file like this
   $ cd Downloads (or wherever you downloaded the file to).
   $ tar -xvf lsseq-1.602.tar.gz

3) install the commands (a supporting python lib will also be
   installed) by first logging in as root then running following
   commands:

   $ su -
   # cd ~yourUserName/Downloads/lsseq-1.602
   # python setup.py install
   # exit

4) ...that's it, you should be able to run the commands "lsseq",
   "expandseq" and "condenseseq" now.

To test lsseq properly cd into a directory containing frames from an
image sequence then "lsseq" the contents of the directory.

If you don't have one handy you can try this to test it.

$ cd ~
$ mkdir tmp
$ cd tmp
$ touch aaa.001.tif aaa.002.tif aaa.003.tif aaa.004.tif aaa.005.tif
$ lsseq
aaa.[001-005].tif z:[1-5]

Note the "z:[1-5]" which is telling you that the frames
aaa.[001-005].tif have zero length, and if you had generated those
with a renderer I'm guessing you'd need to rerender them.  Handy eh!?

Type:

$ lsseq -help

for much more useful info.

suggestions or oodles of praise as the case may be.
