# After doing an update to lsseq, you might find
# that the OLD version is still active. Here's how to fix it.

$ type lsseq
lsseq is hashed (/usr/local/bin/lsseq)

# To clear the entire cache.
$ hash -r

# Or just one entry.
$ hash -d lsseq

$ type lsseq
lsseq is /usr/local/bin/lsseq

# This should fix it.
