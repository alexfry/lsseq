+ add --file-type (ls)
              likewise (to -F), except do not append '*'
+ add -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension (ls)
+ add --indicator-style=WORD (ls)
              append  indicator  with  style  WORD  to  entry  names:
              none (default), slash, file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)

+ add support for sequences that DO NOT have a "descriptiveName", i.e.; 
    for files that are just ####.ext. Non trivial to make this change, but possible.
    Request from Fabrizio - who works in a film archive site and apparently old Kodak
    Cineon sequences frequenly use this kind of convention. (I.e. no file name,
    just frame numbers.)

+ add flag to ignore case in file extensions. Useful for jpg vs JPG etc.

x possibly add better support for quirky and unlikely named sequences (for example),
    a.01.jpg, a.02.jpg, a.03.jpg, ..., a.0100.jpg, a.0101.jpg, a.0102.jpg
    So, what is that? Two padded, four padded, no padding? Anyway, I may need to
    fix this because my util "renum" makes use of lsseq output format, and if
    lsseq doesn't handle this properly then it's hard to use renum to fix crazily
    nanmed/numbered sequences like this. (I did come come across this once!)

    Update: No. This can only happen as a result of some other program creating 
    buggy output. Taking care of this also implies taking care of endless other
    special cases which will almost never happen. So, not fixing this.

    WRT the issue with renum - hand edit the command line to add appropriate padding
    in the few cases that this might crop up. Just make sure that renum handles such
    cases better.

+ WRT above ^^^ - possibly check for any sequences that have BAD PADDING and report them
    as they are discovered? Except if silent mode?

+ check - Did I ever fix this bug? (Example follows)

    % cd /data/commercial/20592_chevrolet_cruze_reveal/cg/sequences/sq2000/sh0110/images/comp
    % ls
    2000_0110_comp_v002
    % lsseq -P *
    2000_0110_comp_v002/2000_0110_comp_v002_l.[0095-0136].exr
    % lsseq -p *
    /data/commercial/20592_chevrolet_cruze_reveal/cg/sequences/sq2000/sh0110/images/comp/2000_0110_comp_v002_l.[0095-0136].exr

    NOTE! It's missing the directory  2000_0110_comp_v002
    Also check lsseq'ing abs paths mixed with relative path names.
    Also, boundry contidions like only one directory in the current dir etc. (as above).
