+ add --file-type (ls)
              likewise (to -F), except do not append '*'
+ add -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension (ls)
+ add --indicator-style=WORD (ls)
              append  indicator  with  style  WORD  to  entry  names:
              none (default), slash, file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)

+ add support for sequences that DO NOT have a "descriptiveName", i.e.; 
for files that are just ####.ext. Non trivial to make this change, but possible.
Request from Fabrizio - who works in a film archive site and apparently old Kodak
Cineon sequences frequenly use this kind of convention. (I.e. no file name,
just frame numbers.)

+ add flag to ignore case in file extensions. Useful for jpg vs JPG etc.

+ add better support for quirky and unlikely named sequences (for example),
  a.01.jpg, a.02.jpg, a.03.jpg, ..., a.0100.jpg, a.0101.jpg, a.0102.jpg
  So, what is that? Two padded, four padded, no padding? Anyway, I need to
  fix this because my util "renum" makes use of lsseq output format, and if
  lsseq doesn't handle this properly then it's hard to use renum to fix crazily
  nanmed/numbered sequences like this. (I did come come across this once!)

+ check - Did I ever fix this bug? (Example follows)

    % cd /data/commercial/20592_chevrolet_cruze_reveal/cg/sequences/sq2000/sh0110/images/comp
    % ls
    2000_0110_comp_v002
    % lsseq -P *
    2000_0110_comp_v002/2000_0110_comp_v002_l.[0095-0136].exr
    % lsseq -p *
    /data/commercial/20592_chevrolet_cruze_reveal/cg/sequences/sq2000/sh0110/images/comp/2000_0110_comp_v002_l.[0095-0136].exr

    NOTE! It's missing the directory  2000_0110_comp_v002
    Also check lsseq'ing abs paths mixed with relative path names.
    Also, boundry contidions like only one directory in the current dir etc. (as above).
